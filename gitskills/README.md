I loved you some time age; since then I feel that I love you a thousand times better.Ah, let ,e see some of your faults; be less beautiful, less graceful, less tender, less good.But never be jealous and never shed tears.Your tears send me out of my mind and they set my very blood on fire.
I do love you,Livy ... as the dew loves the flowers;as the birds love the sunshines; as the wavelets love the breeze; as mothers love their first-born; as memory loves old faces; as the yearning tides love the moon; as the angels love the pure in heart... Take my kiss and my benediction, and try to be reconciled to the fact that I am.
